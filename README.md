# What

A template for a godot-rust project.

# How

Clone it, open the `project.godot` file in any Godot version 4.1+.

`template.sh` takes 1 argument, which is the name of your project. So `./template.sh DodgeTheCreeps`.

`build-web.sh` does what it sounds like. It will grab and install emscripten and the nightly toolchain for you too.

# Why

[The setup steps](https://godot-rust.github.io/book/intro/setup.html) [are all pretty](https://godot-rust.github.io/book/intro/hello-world.html) [much the same](https://godot-rust.github.io/book/toolchain/export-web.html) every time.
